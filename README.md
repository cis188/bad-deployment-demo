# Instructions for Deployment
## From your co-worker Bob, who quit last week:

I know you usually just write the code for our website and let me handle the deployment, but I'm leaving, so I wrote up some instructions for you in this file.

Good luck. I honestly don't remember the exact steps myself, but this should point you in the right direction. I hope. 

# Run the website locally
Run `hugo server -D` to view the website locally. Make sure it looks good.

# Deploy the website
1. Create an EC2 instance.
2. Log in into the instance and run the site locally from there.
3. Go to the website link to check deployment works.
